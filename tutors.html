			<h2>Donald Trump</h2>
			<p class="bio">
			Donald J. Trump grew up in a poor neighborhood and with an extremely poor family. 
			His father could only give Trump, at a very young age, a small loan of a million dollars. 
			He later founded two casinos in Atlantic City, but after many years and after three or possibly forty-two failed marriages, 
			he declared bankruptcy and decided to leave Atlantic City in the same way that he prepares his hair every morning. 
			After many years of denying climate change, avoiding the IRS, and "respecting women" at his Miss Universe pageants, he discovered two things: 
			Twitter and the fact that anyone, and literally anyone, could run for president.
