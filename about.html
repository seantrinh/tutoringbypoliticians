				<h2>Sean Trinh</h2>
				<p>Sean Trinh grew up in Hammonton, New Jersey, but after high school, he decided to pursue undergraduate studies at Oxford University where he majored in 17th Century British Literature and Philosophy. He later dropped out of Oxford during his sophomore year to start and manage his own company, Trinh Enterprises, so that Drake's lyric from Pop Style, "dropped outta school now we dumb rich, dumb rich," would be relevant to his life. After accumulating a multimillion dollar fortune, he decided to enroll at Stevens Institute of Technology because he heard it was the easiest way of blowing off said fortune and still managing to accumulate enough debt to be forced to live with his mother for the next thirty years of his life. In his freshman year at Stevens, he decided to launch another company, Tutoring by Politicians, alongside four co-founders, whom he intends to exploit in the future so that he can make enough money to buy popcorn at the movie theater. To all of those who foolishly enroll with Tutoring by Politicians, Sean's advice is this: "If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon shoot you."</p>

				<h2>Philip Giordano</h2>
				<p>Mr. Giordano was born and raised in the tropical paradise of Staten Island, NY, notably famous for the worst heroin crisis in America, and Eric Garner. Giordano managed to evade all of the malicious parts of Staten Island and graduated as valedictorian from high school, and pursued undergraduate studies at Princeton University, studying Political Science. He lived three dorms away from Ted Cruz. Giordano once said, "this guy is f---ing crazy", and transferred to Harvard, after Ted Cruz tried to kill him Zodiac style. Giordano then earned a B.A. in Political Science. In a twisted chain of events, Giordano later started graduate studies at Penn State University, studying Computer Science and earning his M.S. Giordano earned his Ph.D at Stevens Institute of Technology, where he met the other founding fathers of Tutoring by Politicians. He then joined the team, and thus, Tutoring by Politicians was born.</p>

				<h2>James Spaniak</h2>
				<p>James Spaniak grew up in West Chester, Pennsylvania and attended Rustin High School and graduating at the age of 15 before moving onto Harvard for 4 years. After graduating from Harvard with a PHd in law he wanted to help the general public understand politics more. With this inspiration in mind, along with the other founders, "Tutoring By Politicians" was created. Other side info includes an IQ exceeding 200 and extensive knowledge in all subjects.</p>

				<h2>Stephen Szemis</h2>
				<p>Stephen is a rumor, recognizable only as deja vu and dismissed just as quickly. He doesnâ€™t exist; he was never even born. Anonymity is his name. Silence his native tongue. He is no longer part of the System. He is above the System. Over it. Beyond it. He is "them." He is "they." He is the assistant designer of this website.</p>

				<h2>Jerry Remig</h2>
				<p>Jerry Remig grew up in Madison, New Jersey. After surviving High School he dropped college after one year to start a music career. After 3 months his music career failed so he decided to become an artist in New York. After being told his art was horrible he began to write satire politics articles on The Onion. When off with 4 friends he met in New York City, he came up with the idea of Tutoring by Politicians and they started the project.</p>
